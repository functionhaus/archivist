Heat is a 1995 American neo-noir crime film written, produced, and directed by
Michael Mann, starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Val Kilmer. De Niro plays
Neil McCauley, a seasoned professional at robberies, and Pacino plays Lt.
Vincent Hanna, an LAPD robbery-homicide detective tracking down Neil's crew
after a botched heist leaves three security guards dead. The story is based on
the former Chicago police officer Chuck Adamson's pursuit during the 1960s of a
criminal named McCauley, after whom De Niro's character is named. Heat is a
remake by Mann of an unproduced television series he had worked on, the pilot of
which was released as the TV movie L.A. Takedown in 1991.
